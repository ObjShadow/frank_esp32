/*
 * Well I have to admit that I did a bad job when creating module display and hardware, they should be either merged,
 * or be separated into more modules, but, well, I'm lazy to fix this issue, and since the code will work no matter how
 * I arrange these modules, and the readability won't be influenced too much with enough comments, so just let it go ;)
 *
 * Hope one day I or someone else would fix it...
 *
 * Module display: code for OLED display, and for WS2812.
 * Module hardware: code for I2S devices (microphone and amplifier), and buttons.
 * These modules should only provide a wrap for GPIO and bus operations. Their logic should be implemented in main.c .
